# Memory-Game
I’ve always loved the classic memory game because it sharpens focus, improves recall, and is just plain fun. That inspiration led me to create my own fast-paced version — with a twist!

This game challenges your memory and your speed. You only have a limited number of moves and a countdown timer, so you need to stay sharp, think quickly, and act even faster. It’s a fun way to boost your mental agility while racing against the clock!
